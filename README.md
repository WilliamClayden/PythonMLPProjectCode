# PythonMLPProjectCode
These documents are python code used to develop a basic machine learning solution for a multi-layer perceptron (neural network).
This was part of a Data Science masters coursework in which we had to write our own solution to a machine learning algorithm then
test to collect data and evaluate the results with R.
